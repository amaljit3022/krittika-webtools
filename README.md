# 🌠 Krittika WebTools

**Krittika WebTools** is a free, browser-based suite of everyday utility tools designed for ease, simplicity, and cross-device accessibility. It is part of **The Krittika Project** — a mission to build clean, purposeful, and open-source public utilities guided by real-life needs.

Developed entirely with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript (Stage 1), this project serves as a foundation for future expansions, themes, and powerful integrations.

## 🔧 Concept Note

Krittika WebTools was envisioned to bring together commonly needed tools under a single, minimalist interface. Most web tools today are either bloated or ad-heavy — this project aims to provide fast, aesthetic, and distraction-free experiences to users across devices.

It’s named after *Krittika*, symbolizing guidance, clarity, and creative engineering — representing tools that serve with elegance and purpose.
