# 🛠️ Krittika WebTools

> **One place. All tools. Simple interface. Big impact.**

Welcome to **Krittika WebTools** — a growing collection of lightweight calculation and utility tools crafted to solve the everyday challenges we all face. Whether it's figuring out your age to the day, calculating EMIs, converting currencies or measuring distances — these little tasks often take more time than they should. This project is an attempt to bring all those “small but useful” calculators into one clean, responsive and reliable platform.

## 🎯 Why I Built This

As an engineer and father, I found myself jumping across different apps and sites just to do simple tasks like unit conversions or calculating BMI. Most tools are either overloaded, filled with ads, or lack consistency in design. I wanted one place that felt fast, light, familiar — and accessible on any device.

**Krittika WebTools** is my answer to that need — a place I’ll keep expanding with more day-to-day tools over time.

## 🧠 Philosophy

Small tools. Big help.

We don’t always need apps with 50MB packages and accounts. Sometimes a few lines of clean code can solve real-life problems — from students to engineers, from working parents to retirees. This project is a quiet attempt to prove just that.
